# YourStackMyStack.meetup-str

All relevant infos for our meetups in Stuttgart, DE.

## Goal

In pre-pandemic life, there were multiple *physical* meetups organized in the city, Stuttgart (DE), our base location.
**What is a meetup?** In short: Having chats about a common topic and the one or the other cold drink.

After a first "pilot" meetup in December 2022 the goal was to support the re-initialization of the meetup scene in Stuttgart, by organizing one meetup ourselves. After a short discussion about the topic, we concluded, that we want to start with a "Stammtisch", inviting tech leaders - especially in web development - from the local area, who want to share ideas & learnings about their tech stacks and architectures they use in their products and/or services. From a members perspective, the experience will be, that another member shares thoughts and maybe that will motivate me to also share my own. #YourStackMyStack
